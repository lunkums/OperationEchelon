# Operation Echelon

A puzzle game inspired by Linear Algebra.

## About

Operation Echelon was made almost entirely within a two-week period following the spring semester of my Junior
year in college. The gameplay is inspired by the techniques I learned in a course I took on Linear Algebra,
which became one of my favorite classes due to the professor's charm and humor. After watching a GDC talk on
[practical creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyVTxGpEO30), I was inspired to make a short game and realized that applying row operations to a
matrix would serve as a fun and simple game loop. Operation Echelon is completely UI-based, which I think
expedited the development process. Most assets are taken from open source game art websites. If you read this
far, thank you!
